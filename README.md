## About qBraid

### What is qBraid Lab?

> qBraid Lab is a web-based JupyterLab deployment providing curated software tools for for researchers and developers in quantum computing. It hosts 30+ configurable quantum software environments in Python, Julia, C++, and Q#, integrates with GitHub, VSCode, and ChatGPT, has a breadth of collaborative tools that enable sharing notebooks, environments, and code snippets, and provides direct access to a robust suite of computing resources, encompassing scalable CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs.
