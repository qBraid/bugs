# FAQ 
qBraid is continuously updating and improving its features! Here's an FAQ page for those who are interested in learning more. 
All resources are also available on our [docs](http://qbraid-qbraid.readthedocs-hosted.com)

### what is qBraid?

qBraid is a platform that provides a seamless environment for coding and accessing quantum computers for research.

### Why Quantum computing?

Quantum Computers enable a paradigm shift. From bits where information is stored only in 0 or 1, we leap forwards with qubits to a superposition of 0 and 1.


### what is it that makes us unique in the quantum community?

A platform to support solutions using different frameworks and real quantum computation to create applications in different fields, such as chemistry, and optimization, among others. 

### When registering for the first time what can you do?

There is access to the qBraid lab and different tutorials that one can access to get started in quantum computing.

### what QPUs can you use?

qBraid has access to different QPUs and simulators from large companies such as AWS, D-Wave, Google, IBM, OQC, Rigetti, Xanadu, QuEra, IonQ, etc.

### how to get started in qBraid?

There are different tutorials in the platform in which you have to work with the default qbraid kernel to validate that the SDK is supported in the virtual lab and even connect your code to a QPU (check more [qbraid lab demo](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-lab-demo)). To install more dependencies, like AWS, Qiskit, etc., you must have credits in your account.

### what are credits?

To access all the services that the Qbraid platform has, you must register some credits in your account, these will be deducted when using the QPUs. For example, it can be the number of shots or the running time of your program in QPUs and these will be represented as negative credits.

### how much is a credit?

Each credit is worth $.01 USD.

You can purchase credits or obtain a monthly plan [here](https://account.qbraid.com/billing).
